My name is Chris Stoumpos and I work professionally as a Senior Software Engineer. I graduated with a Diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering in University of Patras (Greece). My main languages are C++ and C in the domains of embedded systems, robotics, edge computing, HPC and more. In my free time I also like to play around with Rust.

This blog will be dedicated to exploring C++. We will dive into a broad range of topics, from basic syntax and object-oriented principles to advanced topics like memory management, multithreading, template metaprogramming, best practices and more.
